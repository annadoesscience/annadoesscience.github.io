I am currently working as a research assistant at the <a href="https://cles.umk.pl/">Centre for Language Evolution Studies</a>, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland. Additionally, I am a Fulbright Graduate Student Award recipient and a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Psychology, Oakland University, Michigan. I work under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.toddkshackelford.com/">Todd K. Shackelford</a>. My focus lies within the <a href="https://www.cep.ucsb.edu/primer.html">evolutionary psychology</a> framework. I am most interested in an evolutionary perspective on the <a href="https://annadoesscience.github.io/projects/1_radical/">radicalization of sociopolitical views</a> but I am also involved in many other <a href="https://annadoesscience.github.io/projects/">cool projects</a>! Every day I grow more excited about how little is known, and how much room for improvement remains in the field. That provides me with growing motivation for further research into the subject.

When not in the lab, I enjoy hiking through the wilderness, trying out new musical instruments, not losing chess matches, and playing fantasy computer games. I also love mossy rocks, snowy winters, and fighting those arguing that correlation implies causation. Due to a set of unfortunate events, I also <a href="https://annadoesscience.github.io/projects/4_analog/"><i>cannot into space</i></a> (though I am really trying to).<br /><br />
