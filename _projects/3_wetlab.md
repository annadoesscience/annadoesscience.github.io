I participated in research on male white-faced capuchins. I investigated the link between rank in the social hierarchy and testosterone level. I mainly worked in the laboratory on the methanol extraction process, preparing samples for transportation, sterilizing laboratory equipment, disposing of hazardous waste, and other lab maintenance activities.
