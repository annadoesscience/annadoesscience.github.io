A short and fun exploratory project! It is being conducted opportunistically while conducting the <a href="https://szala.org/projects/soctop/">Social Topics project</a>. :)

The basic idea is that various demographic cohorts differ when it comes to how much they talk about pets. I am curious if the Spokes database (PÄ™zik, <a href="https://ep.liu.se/ecp/116/009/ecp15116009.pdf">2014</a>) would be enough to draw any meaningful conclusions about those conversations.

Pets are defined as animals kept primarily for a person's entertainment or company (therefore, farm animals, laboratory animals, or working animals are not considered pets).
