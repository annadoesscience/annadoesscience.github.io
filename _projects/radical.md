The human evolutionary history extends back hundreds of thousands of years. Social media, a digital social networking tool, is a relatively novel addition to our lives, and yet it has already drastically changed the way we function as a society. Social media also has impacted the process of constructing opinions on our surrounding reality, including forming views about important matters, such as sociopolitical views.

The objective of this project is to explore the development of sociopolitical perspectives among US Americans using an evolutionary-based theoretical framework. Once initiated, the project will involve a thorough examination of participants' use of social media, focusing on how their sociopolitical views may have radicalized concerning US-specific issues. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of their online behavior from an evolutionary psychology perspective will be conducted to determine if their interactions on social media are primarily cooperative or hostile.
