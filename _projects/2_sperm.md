While at the Department of Psychology, Oakland University, MI, USA, I helped with two projects investigating links between behaviour and ejaculate quality. Both studies were conducted using the SQA-V automated semen analyzer. The data from both projects are currently being investigated.

✤ In the first project, we studied the sociosexuality of romantic couples. We were investigating the potential links between relationship dynamics in couples and male ejaculate quality. The goal of this research is to understand how sociosexual factors may influence male reproductive biology.

✤ In the second project, we studied ejaculate adjustment and non-consensual sexual activity. We wanted to see whether some men produce higher-quality ejaculates when primed with stimuli depicting non-consensual sexual activity.
