✤ In the first project, we investigated Cuban voices in order to study relationships between individual and social factors that influence the perception of the human voice. 

✤ In the second project, we conducted a cross-cultural investigation of voice modulation in professional versus personal social contexts. In a cross-cultural sample of 300 men and women from six countries, we test whether vocalisers differentially modulate key vocal parameters as a function of the professional hierarchical status and sex of the listener.
