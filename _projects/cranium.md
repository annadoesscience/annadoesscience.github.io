I have been grateful to have the opportunity of working with Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=VoBNag8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Robin I. M. Dunbar</a> at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.

While in Oxford, my main task was to collect data on the cranial anatomy of various Hominidae species found in archaeological excavations and their altitudes of habitation. The data from the project is still being analysed, so I will keep the details a secret. ðŸ¤«
