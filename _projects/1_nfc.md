I am working on this project as part of my pursuit of a Ph.D. degree at the Department of Psychology, Oakland University, USA, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Todd-Shackelford">Todd K. Shackelford</a> (committee members: <a href="http://www.zeigler-hill.com/">Virgil Zeigler-Hill</a> & <a href="https://www.mcdonaldpeplab.com/people">Melissa M. McDonald</a>).

<i>Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.</i> â€“ <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6088867-chaos-isn-t-a-pit-chaos-is-a-ladder-many-who>Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish</a>

The study investigates the relationship between the Need for Chaos (NFC) (see <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0147>here</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/need-for-chaos-and-motivations-to-share-hostile-political-rumors/7E50529B41998816383F5790B6E0545A>here</a>) and political preferences, focusing on the United States and Poland within their distinct historical, political, and cultural contexts. Grounded in the unique trajectories of these nations, the research aims to understand chaos-seeking tendencies within different political landscapes. The decision to focus on the US and Poland is justified by their unique historical narratives and varied party systems, providing a fertile ground for exploring the universal or culturally specific aspects of the NFC-political preference link.

Additionally, considering the dynamically evolving political landscape in Poland, the study will provide a Polish translation, adaptation, and validation of the Need for Chaos Scale-Revised. This adapted scale becomes particularly pertinent amid swift political transformations in the contemporary Polish context. As Poland approaches the 2025 presidential elections, where a president from the opposing political alliance that gained power in 2023 is likely to win due to rapidly changing support for political parties and trust in politicians, understanding the Polish dynamics of the NFC becomes crucial.
