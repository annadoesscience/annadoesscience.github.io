This is a brand new project in collaboration with <a href="https://www.unine.ch/ipto/home/collaborateurstrices/miani-alessandro.html">Alessandro Miani</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VX2w_T4AAAAJ&hl=pl">Sławomir Wacewicz</a>.

The project is about how a potentially conspiratorial message “evolves” when passed from actor to actor depending on whether the actor is high or low in conspiratorial thinking. In other words, if a person is already inclined to believe in conspiracy theories, how might that influence the way they interpret and pass on a potentially conspiratorial message? And conversely, if a person is less likely to believe in conspiracy theories, how might that impact the message as it's passed on?

The details are still being enthusiastically discussed, so that's all I am willing to share for now. Stay tuned for more soon!
