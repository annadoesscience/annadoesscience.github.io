This is a colaboration with <a href="https://www.unine.ch/ipto/home/collaborateurstrices/miani-alessandro.html">Alessandro Miani</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VX2w_T4AAAAJ&hl=pl">Sławomir Wacewicz</a>.

This is a brand new project about how a potentially conspiratorial message “evolves” when passed from actor to actor depending on whether the actor is high or low in conspiratorial thinking. The details are still being enthusiastically discussed, so that's all I am willing to share for now. Stay tuned for more soon!
