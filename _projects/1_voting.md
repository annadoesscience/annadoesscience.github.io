New project announcement! ðŸ¥³

A partnership has been forged with a distinguished UK-based research group, the specifics of which I'm currently keeping confidential. Together, our efforts will center around experimental studies investigating the nuanced emotions and feelings tied to the voting experience. It's essential to note that the project is still in the early stages of development, promising exciting insights into the emotional dynamics inherent in democratic participation. Stay tuned for further details as this research unfolds!
